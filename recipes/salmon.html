<p> That right there is our beautiful salmon.</p>
<h2>Description </h2>
<p> The salmon we'll be making isnt like others. This one is cut in a way that makes the skin tender but still crispy and the meat super tender.
    The way we cook it will ensure a massive distribution of flavors that will allow us to enjoy eating it the entire time.
</p>
<p> Now, lets learn what we need and how to cook it.<p/>

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh salmon</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Smoked paprika,Garlic powder, onion powder,pepper, 1tp salt,Thyme(or your preferred seasonings)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not much right? Thats because this is a fairy simple dish. You can also use cinnimon and honey instead of all that
        if you dont want it to be savory.
    </p>
    <h2> How to cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> First take out your salmon and place it onto a nonstick pan. I personally like to put the onion powder on the bottom of the pan to change the taste of the skin.

        </li>
        <li> Take your knife and cut the salmon in a way that makes it look like it has abs.</li>
        <li> Then season the salmon whichever way you want, the cuts allow you to put it inside the salmon too.</li>
        <li> Next take butter and cut it small enough to insert it into the cracks where you cut the salmon, this will add more taste and when it cooks
            it will gurantee an even spread. </li>
            <li> lastly pop that bad boy in the oven at 350 untill its cooked and enjoy. Simple right?</li>

    </ol>
